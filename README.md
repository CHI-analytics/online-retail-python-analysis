### 🧠 Customer Segmentation using RFM Analysis

To better understand customer behavior and identify high-value customers, an **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** analysis was performed.

**RFM Metrics Explained:**
- **Recency (R):** How recently a customer made a purchase  
- **Frequency (F):** How often a customer makes purchases  
- **Monetary (M):** How much revenue a customer generates  

Customers were scored on each dimension and combined into an overall **RFM score** to segment them into actionable groups.

**Key Insights:**
- Customers with high RFM scores represent loyal and high-value customers who drive a significant portion of revenue.
- Low-recency or low-frequency customers indicate churn risk and can be targeted with re-engagement campaigns.
- RFM segmentation enables data-driven marketing, retention strategies, and personalized promotions.
